While many Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) models have been proposed, there has yet to be a comprehensive comparison of their relative performances and computational requirements. Further, there is no open-source software to easily fit some of these models.

I am developing an R software package, [bayesNMF](https://github.com/jennalandy/bayesNMF), that implements various model specifications of Bayesian NMF. I also include the option to learn the latent rank as a part of the Bayesian model. I am comparing these models in terms of reconstruction error, correctness of the learned latent factors (in simulation studies), memory usage, and speed.
