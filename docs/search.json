    "title": "Getting Started with Mutational Signatures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mutational signatures analysis is a new way to characterize cancer genomes in a way that is interpretable and clinically relevant. Most methods are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This article serves as an introduction to the biological motivation for mutational signatures, the statistical methods used, and a sample analysis on simulated data.\nTable of Contents\n\nBiological Motivation\nDefining Mutational Signatures\nStatistical Methods\nSample Analysis\n\n\n\nBiological Motivation\nUntil recently, cancer diagnosis and treatment was based primarily on the tissue of origin, clinical presentation, and tumor morphology. The ability to sequence tumor DNA has changed this. The term “cancer” now refers to many diseases “differentiated on the basis of varying combinations of cancer gene mutations” [Van Hoeck et al. 2019].\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell replication due to mutations in somatic, or non-germline, cells [Baez-Ortega and Gori 2019]. There are some well-studied biological processes that lead to somatic mutations. For instance, in non-melanoma skin cancers, sunlight exposure leaves its trace through C-to-T transitions at dipyrimidine sequences and CC-to-TT tandem mutations. On the other hand, in smoking-associated lung cancers, we see G-to-T transversions, particularly at methylated CpG sites in TP53 (linked to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) [Pfeifer 2010]. However, we are still in the dark as far as most of the processes that cause somatic mutations in cancer [Alexandrov et al. 2013].\nThough they hadn’t yet been defined, Stratton, Cambelle, & Futreal (2009) perfectly summarizes the biological motivation for mutational signatures:\n\nthe catalogue of somatic mutations present in a cancer cell … represents a cumulative archaeological record of all the mutational processes the cancer cell has experienced throughout the lifetime of the patient. It provides a rich, and predominantly unmined, source of information for cancer epidemiologists and biologists with which to interrogate the development of individual tumors\n\nMutational signatures analysis is a recent development to model a tumor’s mutational landscape as the composition of multiple mutational processes working at once.\nMost signatures focus on single base substitution (SBS) mutations, though signatures have been developed for double base substitutions, small insertions and deletions, copy number variations, structural variation, and RNA single base substitutions [Tate et al. 2019].\n\n\n\nDefining Mutational Signatures\n\nM = Mutational catalog\nM[k,g] = counts of SBS mutation type k present in tumor genome g\nP = Signature matrix\nP[k,n] = probability of SBS mutation type k resulting from mutational signature n\n\nFor SBS signatures, a “type” of mutation is defined by the single base substitution and the nucleotides on either side. For instance, ACT &gt; AGT has a C&gt;T substitution (the mutation) and an A on the left and T on the right (the context). In the simplest case, we’re not concerned with what DNA strand the mutation was on, so we only consider substitutions of an A or a C. This gives six options for the substitution A&gt;C, A&gt;G, A&gt;T, C&gt;A, C&gt;G, C&gt;T, four options for the nucleotide on the left, and four options for the nucleotide on the right, giving 6 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 4 = 96 SBS mutation types.\nA tumor’s mutational catalog is its count of each mutation type. The catalog for each tumor genome g, M[ ,g], is a vector of length 96. The full mutational catalog matrix M has dimension 96 x G where G is the total number of tumor genomes, and tumors’ catalogs are columns.\nA mutational signature is a mathematical representation of a mutational process. A signature defines how likely the mutational process is to give rise to each type of mutation. Mathematically, signature n, denoted P[,n], is a probability distribution over these mutation types. The full signatures matrix P has dimension 96 x N where N is the total number of signatures, and signatures are columns.\n\n\n\nDefinition of a mutational signature\n\n\nBelow is an example of a common visualization of a signature (COSMIC SBS3 here). Mutation types are grouped based on the central single base substitution, each with 16 options for context.\n\n\n\nCOSMIC SBS3 GRCh37 (signatures v3.4) [Tate et al. 2019]\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Methods\nBiologically, we said that a tumor’s mutational landscape is the composition of multiple mutational processes working at once. Mathematically, we represent this by defining a tumor’s mutational catalog as a linear combination of multiple mutational signatures. We define each weight E[n,g] as the contribution of mutational signature n to tumor genome g, or equivalently the exposure of tumor genome g to mutational signature n. This definition simplifies to the expression M = PE.\nBecause M is a counts matrix, and P a matrix of probabilities, both are inherently non-negative. We define E as non-negative as well, because mutational processes can only add mutations, not get rid of them*. Although we originally defined signatures P[,n] as probability distributions summing to one, we can rescale matrices after the fact rather than incorporating the addition constraint here.\n\n\n\nNon-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for mutational signatures\n\n\nThe matrix decomposition M = PE with all non-negative matrices can be solved with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). \n* I note that the use positive weights is different from other matrix decomposition or dictionary learning applications to genomics. For example, if we were looking at RNA-seq data, a mutational process may increase or decrease gene expression, so weights would be allowed to be negative.\n\n\nSimulated Data & Sample Analysis\n\nGenerating Simulated Data\nWe can generate simulated data based off of the current “gold standard” signatures from COSMIC [Tate et al. 2019]. Below, I use their first five signatures and generate 20 tumor genomes.\nN &lt;- 5\nG &lt;- 20\n\n# download COSMIC signatures, use the first N as our P\nurl &lt;- \"https://cog.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic-signatures-production/documents/COSMIC_v3.3.1_SBS_GRCh37.txt\"\ncosmic_signatures &lt;- read.csv(url, sep = '\\t', row.names = 1)\nP &lt;- as.matrix(cosmic_signatures[,1:N])\n\n# simulate # mutations from each signature n to each tumor genome g\n# centered s.t. each tumor has around 1000 total mutations\nE &lt;- matrix(nrow = N, ncol = G)\nn_mutations &lt;- 1000\nfor (g in 1:G) {\n    E[,g] &lt;- rpois(N, 1000/N)\n}\n\n# simulate mutational catalog centered at PE\nM = matrix(nrow = 96, ncol = G)\nfor (g in 1:G) {\n    M[,g] &lt;- rpois(96, P %*% E[,g])\n}\n\n\nAnalysis Using NMF\nTraditionally, optimal P and E matrices are found through gradient descent using multiplicative rather than additive updates to ensure non-negativity. In R, gradient descent NMF can be performed using the NMF package on CRAN [Gaujoux and Seoighe 2010]. \ninstall.packages(\"NMF\")\nlibrary(NMF)\nMore recently, NMF has been translated to the Bayesian space, where priors are put on P and E and an optimal solution is found by maximizing the posteriors of P and E using MCMC methods (I will be publishing articles on the specifics of these methods soon!). In R, Bayesian NMF can be fit using my bayesNMF package on GitHub [Landy 2023].\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"jennalandy/bayesNMF\")\nlibrary(bayesNMF)\nFor either method, we must specify the reduced dimension rank, or in our case, the number of mutational signatures to fit. Although we know the true number of signatures is 5 because the data is simulated, I will proceed as if this is unknown to reflect a real data analysis.\nWe can pass in ranks from 2 up to 15 to the NMF package in order to choose a rank. This is always a rather subjective choice, and there are several approaches to choose the optimal rank. Many introductory tutorials will reference the elbow method, or choosing the rank that is at the inflection point of the RSS curve. A more sophisticated approach focuses on Brunet’s cophenetic correlation cofficient (CCC) method. The CCC measures dispersion for the consensus matrix. This method chooses the rank after which the CCC begins to decrease (in our data, at rank = 5, top left plot below).\nnmf_res &lt;- NMF::nmf(adeno_catalog, rank = 2:15)\nplot(nmf_res)\n\nMoving forward with rank = 5, we can run both gradient descent and Bayesian methods:\ngd_nmf_rank7_res &lt;- NMF::nmf(M, rank = 5)\ngd_nmf_rank7_P &lt;- nmf_rank7_res@fit@W\ngd_nmf_rank7_E &lt;- nmf_rank7_res@fit@H\n\n# This function saves results in bayes_nmf_rank7.RData and \n# logs progress in bayes_nmf_rank7.log\nbayes_nmf_rank7_res &lt;- bayesNMF::nmf_normal_exponential(\n  M, N = 5,\n  file = \"bayes_nmf_rank7\"\n)\nbayes_nmf_rank7_P &lt;- bayes_nmf_rank7_res$P.mean\nbayes_nmf_rank7_E &lt;- bayes_nmf_rank7_res$E.mean\n\n\nEvaluate Results\nFinally, we can investigate how our estimated mutational signatures align with the true signatures used for simulating the data.\nbayesNMF::get_heatmap(est_P = gd_nmf_rank7_P, true_P = P)\nbayesNMF::get_heatmap(est_P = bayes_nmf_rank7_P, true_P = P)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVan Hoeck, A., Tjoonk, N.H., van Boxtel, R. et al.

    "text": "CRISPR can be used to knock out a particular gene, or “perturb” it, so that it is no longer functional. Single cell RNA sequencing on perturbed and control cells (perturb-seq) can be used to measure the changes in gene expressions due to the perturbation, which are usually sparse. These measurements can then give insight into the functions and/or pathways of the perturbed gene. Biologists are interested in the perturbation effects of thousands of genes and their millions of combinations, but evaluating each combination experimentally is infeasible.\nWe are working on predicting changes in gene expressions given a set of perturbations utilizing a graph of known functions from the gene ontology (GO) database. We use a graph neural network to learn perturbation embeddings, which importantly, will allow predictions for combinations of perturbations that were never tested experimentally. We are focusing on the transferability of this model across datasets and making predictions that are robust across cell types and sequencing depths."

For instance, a sequence ACT mutated to AGT has a C&gt;G substitution (the mutation) with an A on the left and a T on the right (the context). We represent this mutation type as “A[C&gt;G]T”.\nIn the simplest case, we’re not concerned with which DNA strand the mutation was on, so we only consider substitutions at a C or a T. This gives six options for the substitution (C&gt;A, C&gt;G, C&gt;T, T&gt;A, T&gt;C, T&gt;G) and four options each for the nucleotides on the left and right, so a total of \\(6 \\times 4 \\times 4\\) = 96 SBS mutation types. We use base-pair matching to convert mutations at a G or an A into one of these 96 types.\nA tumor’s mutational catalog is how often each mutation type appears across its genome. The catalog for each tumor genome \\(g\\), \\(M_{g}\\), is a vector of length 96. The full mutational catalog matrix \\(M\\) has dimension 96 x G where G is the total number of tumor genomes, and tumors’ catalogs are the columns.\n\n\\(M\\) = mutational catalog matrix, our observed data\n\\(M_{kg}\\) = count of mutation type \\(k\\) in tumor genome \\(g\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatent Factors: Mutational Signatures \\(P\\)\nA mutational signature is a mathematical representation of a mutational process defining how likely the mutational process is to give rise to each type of mutation. Mathematically, signature \\(n\\), denoted \\(P_n\\), is a probability distribution over these mutation types. The complete signatures matrix \\(P\\) has dimension 96 x N where N is the total number of signatures, and signatures are columns.\n\n\\(P\\) = signature matrix, our latent factors representing mutational processes\n\\(P_{kn}\\) = probability of mutation type \\(k\\) resulting from mutational signature \\(n\\)\n\\(P_{kn}\\) = Pr(mutation type k | signature n) such that \\(\\sum_k P_{kn} = 1 \\forall n\\)\n\nA common way to visualize individual signatures is as a bar plot of these probabilities, grouped based on the central mutation, where each group has 16 options for the left and right nucleotide context. Below is this type of plot for one signature, COSMIC SBS3.\n\n\n\n\nCOSMIC SBS3 GRCh37 (signatures v3.4). Identified in Nik-Zainal, Alexandrov, et al. (2012)."

    "text": "Statistical Methods\nIn order to model mutational signatures, we need to convert our biological motivation about mutational processes into a mathematical expression using our mathematical definition of mutational signatures.\nBiologically, we said\n\na tumor’s mutational landscape is the composition of multiple mutational processes working at once.\n\nMathematically, we can say\n\na tumor’s mutational catalog is a linear combination of multiple mutational signatures.\n\nThe weights of this linear combination are defined by a matrix \\(E\\), where \\({E}_{ng}\\) is the number of mutations in tumor genome \\(g\\) attributed to mutational signature \\(n\\). \\(E_{ng}\\) is often called the exposure of tumor genome \\(g\\) to mutational signature \\(n\\) or, equivalently, the contribution of mutational signature \\(n\\) to tumor genome \\(g\\). This definition gives rise to the following matrix factorization problem:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_g =& \\sum_n P_n E_{ng}\\\\\nM = PE, &\\text{ all non-negative}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA necessary restriction is that all our matrices of interest, \\(M\\), \\(P\\), and \\(E\\) have non-negative values. The non-negativity constraint is trivial for the first two because \\(M\\) is a counts matrix and \\(P\\) a matrix of probabilities. The choice for \\(E\\) to be non-negative comes from the biology behind signatures: mutational processes can only add mutations, not get rid of them1, so these weights must be positive as well.\nThis matrix factorization has scale non-identifiability because \\(M = PE\\) and \\(M = (P/2)(2E)\\) are equivalent solutions. For this reason, we can drop the restriction that \\(\\sum_k P_{kn} = 1 \\forall n\\) and rescale the solution after the fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used approach for this type of problem. R and Python packages can be used to run NMF on your local computer easily. The example below shows in each language (1) generating a mutational catalog matrix \\(M\\) with \\(G\\) = 20 samples and no true signal from latent factors and (2) performing NMF and extracting final estimates \\(\\hat P\\) and \\(\\hat E\\).\n\nPythonR\n\n\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import NMF\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nK = 96\nG = 20\nlam = 10\nrank = 4\n\n\nM = np.random.poisson(lam = lam, size = [K, G])\n\nmodel = NMF(n_components = rank)\nP_hat = model.fit_transform(M)\nE_hat = model.components_\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(NMF)\n\nK &lt;- 96\nG &lt;- 20\nlambda &lt;- 10\nrank &lt;- 4\n\nM &lt;- matrix(\n    rpois(n = K*G, lambda = lambda), \n    nrow = K, ncol = G\n)\n\nnmf_res &lt;- NMF::nmf(M, rank = rank)\nP_hat &lt;- nmf_res@fit@W\nE_hat &lt;- nmf_res@fit@H\n\n\n\n\nA separate post with the details of this algorithm and its variations is in progress."

    "text": "Key Literature\nThis is a set of papers that I found very useful to get a solid footing in this field. This is by no means a comprehensive list of all mutational signatures analysis methods or applications.\nNik-Zainal, Alexandrov, et al. (2012) was the first paper to perform mutational signatures analysis as I described above. They looked at the mutational catalogs of 21 breast cancer genomes to extract five mutational signatures. They report a signature that \"is likely due to deamination of 5-methylcytosine, a relatively well-characterized mutational process\", while the rest had unknown origins. Its companion paper (Nik-Zainal, Van Loo, et al. 2012) divides somatic mutations into those shared by all cells in the sample and those that are subclonal. By classifying whether mutations were early clonal, late clonal, or subclonal in regions of copy number gains, they are able to assess the relative contributions of the five signatures at different times during each cancer's evolution.\nLudmil B. Alexandrov et al. (2013) extends these methods into a reproducible framework. They apply this framework to a mutational catalog matrix with samples from 30 different types of cancer and reveal 21 distinct signatures. Some signatures are observed in only one or a subset of cancer types, while others are shared.\nFischer et al. (2013) further extends the NMF methods to incorporate mutational opportunity and uses a probabilistic form of NMF solved using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm rather than gradient descent. Rosales et al. (2016) uses Bayesian NMF and introduces the idea of a differential exposure score associating exposures with clinical data to see how the activity of each signature correlates to clinical results. They also show that the exposure matrix can be used to cluster tumor samples into clinically meaningful subtypes.\nNik-Zainal and Morganella (2017) again compares mutational signatures across cancer types and indicates the need for multi-study and multi-cancer methods. Grabski, Trippa, and Parmigiani (2023) satisfies this need with a Bayesian NMF approach that can jointly analyze multiple mutational catalog matrices, such as different studies or cancer types. This method allows for signatures to be specific to one study or shared by any number of studies.\nTate et al. (2018) introduces COSMIC: the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, a resource kept up to date with the most recently discovered mutational signatures, their proposed etiology, and the cancer types they impact. SBS signatures can be found here and can easily be downloaded for use in analysis. COSMIC has been updated since, most recently with analysis from L. B. Alexandrov et al. (2020).\nOther important references include Baez-Ortega and Gori (2017), which reviews various mathematical models and computational techniques for mutational signature analysis, and Kucab et al. (2019), which experimentally validates the link between certain mutagens and mutational signatures. Van Hoeck et al. (2019) describes the status of mutational signature analysis and discusses future challenges."

    "text": "Data augmentation improves accuracy of ML models for natural language processing tasks, such as neural machine translation (NMT), by increasing the amount and variety of training data. Augmentation approaches for NLP can be applied at the token-level (e.g. contextual replacement) or at the embedding-level (e.g. soft contextual replacement or mixing two sequences by averaging their embeddings with SeqMix). While prior methods keep the semantic meaning of a sentence, a weakness is that they don’t maintain syntax. We addressed this by matching POS in word replacement and token mixing, which shows up to a 1 point increase in BLEU. Further, in prior SeqMix methods, the sequences to be mixed are chosen at random, which we address by combining more similar or different sequences. We found that mixing sequences of similar length shows up to a 0.6 point improvement in BLEU.

Existing methods for estimating fdr often yield different conclusions, yet the unobservable nature of fdr values prevents the use of traditional model selection. Our method circumvents this challenge by ensembling a subset of methods with weights based on their estimated performances, which are computed on synthetic datasets generated to mimic the observed data while including ground truth.
